## Project Overview

This analysis project requires a quick build, quick turnaround data frame that pulls information from available Hawaiian Weather sites.  

### Purpose  

The purpose of this analysis is to help W. Avy to make important business decisions about opening an ice cream shop on the island of Oahu. 
The location is important because climate can vary on the island. W. Ivy wants to be prepared by knowing weather history and patterns in the area where the shop might be located. The data-driven decisions that we will make will be based on temperature and rainfall for the past 7 years from 2010-2017, specifically June and December. These 2 months are far apart 
enough to ensure we have good conditions year-round.   

      - The analysis consists of 2 parts:   
      - Temperature Statistics analysis for June and December for 2010-2017.
      - Rainfall analysis for June and December for 2010-2017.

### Results
The analysis focuses on the temperature and rainfall from six different weather stations.
On Oahu, Hawaii from 2010-2017 and June and December, specifically.  

The first 2 charts show the statistics for June and December – tobs   

1.	**Data**
     -	There are less data points for December (1517 data points) than June (1700 data points).
2.	**Dispersion of the data**
     -	Temperatures are more spread out in December 
     -	June’s mean is 79.94 F and the median is 75.00 F.
     -	December’s mean is 71.04 F and median is 71.0 F.

### Summary 
The data frame tables above give us a quick view of the weather in area, but to fully understand the trends, additional
formats and analysis can be helpful.  I've provided 2 box and whisker charts for more visual understanding.
